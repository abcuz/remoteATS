## Overview

The goal of RemoteATS is to create an intelligent, remotely controllable system that can automatically manage generator operations based on predefined conditions such as load demand, power outages, or scheduled maintenance. As a prototype, this project is in the early stage of development and is intended to demonstrate core functionalities.

---

## Features

- Remote start and stop commands via software interface
- Hardware interface for controlling generator power circuits
- Basic automation based on simulated conditions
- Online control for managing the system via internet
- Prototype hardware setup with STM32 microcontroller integration
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

---

## Hardware Components

- **STM32 Microcontroller** (e.g., STM32F4 series, STM32F1 series, etc.)
- Relay modules for controlling generator power circuits
- Sensors (optional, for automation triggers)
- Power supply units
- Connectivity modules (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc., via external modules or onboard Ethernet)

*Note: As this is a prototype, hardware configurations may vary.*

---

## Software Components

- Firmware running on the STM32 microcontroller
- Web or mobile interface for remote commands
- API for automation and integration
- Online control portal for managing the system remotely
- Logging and status monitoring tools

*Note: The software is currently in development and will evolve over time.*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- STM32 development environment (STM32CubeIDE, PlatformIO, etc.)
- Basic understanding of hardware wiring
- Network setup for remote access

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abcuz/remoteATS.git
```

2. Follow hardware wiring diagrams (to be provided) to connect components to the STM32
3. Build and upload firmware to the STM32 microcontroller
4. Configure network settings
5. Access the control interface or online portal to send start/stop commands

---

## Usage

- Use the web interface, online control portal, or API endpoints to manually start or stop the generator
- Set automation rules based on your requirements (future feature)
- Monitor system status through logs and dashboards

---

## Status

This project is currently in the **prototype phase**. Core functionalities are being developed and tested. Feedback and contributions are welcome to help improve and refine the system.
